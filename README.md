# Todo-List-Application
A complete Todo List app where the user can create and store multiple lists


## Description
This unique Todo List application allows users to create and or revisit past lists where they have stored information. To create a list add the list name as a route to the website. i.e /listname The user will be able to store data in that list or delete it. The can revisit the list by typing in the same path in the web broswer as they did when they created the list.

## Technologies used
To build this application I used a variety of technologies from databases to deployment.
Specifically I used:
  - Node.js and Express.js
  - EJS for html templating
  - HTML/CSS
  - Mongoose and MongoDB atlas for the database
  - Heroku to deploy and run the server
